## Overview
Background on Pokémon Pokémon is a video game where players move through a world, catching and training animals called Pokémon. Each Pokémon belongs to a Pokémon species, such as Charmander or Pikachu. Over the course of their lives, Pokémon of one species can strengthen and evolve into a Pokémon of a different species. For example, Charmander is a specific species that can evolve into the species Charmeleon and Charizard. Therefore all three of these Pokémon species have the same evolution chain.
